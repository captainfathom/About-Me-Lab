        <br/>
        <p>I'm a PNW native and wear that badge with pride. I love it here. My wife, Janna, and I calli it the magical promised land, and we're serious. I spent some time in the midwest, but made my way back to the magical promised land because I couldn't take it any more. I'm on a journey that has taken me from being a church pastor, to the non-profit world, and now into this crazy land of software development. I am ready. And overwhelmed!<br/><br/><br/></p>

        <h2 class='edu'>Work Experience</h2>
        <br/>
        <p>I've worked in development for years, but I have been developing people. First as a pastor, then at a university, and finally in the non-profit world. I have learned how to engage people, how to listen, and how to help folks find their passion and impact in the world.<br/><br/><br/></p>

        <h2 class='edu'>Goals</h2>
        <br/>
        <p>I will be a software developer. I want to build things. I want to make things work and find creative solutions. I came to this field after working for folks experiencing homelessness. I wished someone would create a way to give money to folks on the street electronically. I tried, but I needed a developer and no one came to my rescue. Fortunately, someone created this app, but it set me on a path to become the developer I needed. I want to make something to help folks in need. Here I go.<br/><br/><br/></p>
