        <h2>Bio</h2>
        <p>I'm a NW native. I spent some time in the midwest, but made my way back to the magical promised land (aka-the NW) because I love it here. I'm on a journey that has taken me from the non-profit world into this crazy land of software development. I am ready. And overwhelmed!</p>
        <h2>Education</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>M.Div - Western Theological Seminary</li>
          <li>BA - Seattle Pacific University</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Work Experience</h2>
        <p>I've worked in development for years, but I have been developing people. First as a pastor, then at a university, and finally in the non-profit world. I have learned how to engage people, how to listen, and how to help folks find their passion and impact in the world.</p>
        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>I will be a software developer. I want to build things. I want to make things work and find creative solutions. I came to this field after working for folks experiencing homelessness. I wished someone would create a way to give money to folks on the street electronically. I tried, but I needed a developer and no one came to my rescue. Fortunately, someone created this app, but it set me on a path to become the developer I needed. I want to make something to help folks in need. Here I go.</p>
